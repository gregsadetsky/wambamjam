            <h3>How does it work?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Join us for <a href="https://www.recurse.com/calendar/33272">the kick off May 8th 6pm ET</a> at the Recurse Center Hub and simultaneously online for remote participants.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You then have 23 hours to make a weird web instrument.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Submit a .zip file of your instrument code <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/request/aa5qBNMJdOHFNqlnxfif">using this link</a> <b>BEFORE May 9th 5pm ET</b>. Please include all necessary files. It's ok to include node_modules or whatever else, we'll figure it out.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="https://www.recurse.com/calendar/33273">On May 9th at 5pm ET</a>, we will all join a call / presentation. Everyone will then present their instrument for 1 to 2 minutes (depending on the number of submissions).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Everyone from the Recurse community will then vote on their favorite instrument(s) on Zulip.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The maker(s) of the most-voted-for instrument will receive a <b>zeptocore</b> by Recurse's own Zack Scholl! In addition, a <b>pikocore</b> will be randomly drawn among all participants!
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Rules</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>If two instruments are tied for first place in terms of Zulip votes, we'll have to have an "instrument off" which I honestly would kinda love.</li>
                <li>Your instrument doesn't have to be weird, it would just be more fun if it was.</li>
                <li>Your instrument does have to somehow work in a web browser, as much as possible without any external hardware (i.e. it can be MIDI compatible but shouldn't rely on a specific piece of gear).</li>
                <li>As much as you can, try to submit original work that you created during the Wam Bam Jam (i.e. May 8th to May 9th period.)</li>
                <li>It's ok to use existing libraries of course, and bits of code you had laying around, but it's not as fun if you submit something you've been working on for a year.</li>
                <li>You can participate in teams, but you will have to figure out how to divide the pikocore or the zeptocore if you get / win either!</li>
                <li>Don't submit hurtful/awful things. If in doubt, ask Recurse Faculty or <a href="mailto:lepetitg@gmail.com">Greg</a>.</li>
            </ul>
